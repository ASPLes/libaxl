   Memory report (an interesting report)
   [ http://xml.aspl.es/memory-usage-report-17-04-2006.html ]


This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  First official release which comes with all basic functions
  required by most XML developers: XML parsing, DTD validation (not
  supported yet ATTLIST), XML dumping, etc.

  Many memory and execution time improvements has been done to the
  library before this release was done. Check out the memory report
  from the resources section.

Changes from previous release (initial)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] uploading initial source code proposal to implement a XML 1.0
  Third edition compliant implementation.

* [fix] uploading missing autogen.sh file.

* [new] adding a new module axl-stream to implement a streaming
  concept while padding the xml structure. This will allow to write a
  higher level code that could open the possibility to implement
  parsing xml from other sources.  API added:

     - axl_stream_new
     - axl_stream_inspect
     - axl_stream_inspect_several
     - axl_stream_accept
     - axl_stream_free

* [fix] reorganized axl error module to implement application error
  reporting using references rather than hiding it.

* [fix] adding initial code to axl_doc_parse. Now we parse the initial
  xml header [production 23].

* [fix] adding new internal function to get next chunk, inside stream
  API.

* [fix] making axl_stream_inspect to automatically call to
  axl_stream_accept if a call is done without accept previous valid
  inspection. Non valid inspection doesn't produce to accept
  automatically stream consumed.

* [new] adding new API to move the stream an amount provided.
  
   - axl_stream_move

* [new] implemented axl_stream_get_until which returns the all stream
  available until some chunk (or several chunks) are found.

* [new] adding new API to provide an easy way to consume spaces,
  tabular line feed and carry return. (\x20, \x9, \x0A and \x0D). API
  added,
   
   - AXL_CONSUME_SPACES

* [fix] uploading axl_doc_parse implementation that is able to mostly
  parse xml header.

* [new] adding a function to enable API consumers to get the xml
  encoding value for a given axlDoc reference. API added:
   
   - axl_doc_get_encoding.

* [fix] uploading missing VERSION file.

* [new] uploading initial test files and Makefile.am to check the
  library works.

* [new] adding initial test to check if xml document header is
  properly parsed.

* [new] Adding new API to dispose axlDoc instances created.
   
   - axl_doc_free

* [new] Adding more internal API to axl stream module, to allow
  associating an axlDoc instance to axlStream instance so the axlDoc
  instance is deallocated if the stream is done so.

* [new] Adding a top-level type redefinition: bool. This is just a
  redefinition of the int type to bool value. This allow to make more
  explicit type semantic for function and variables that only needs to
  represent the false and true boolean values. Added also macro
  definitions: AXL_TRUE and AXL_FALSE.

* [fix] include cpp header declarations to be usable from c++.

* [fix] LibAxl know successfully parses the xml header specification,
  including encoding and stand alone values and it supports any
  interleaving "white space" the in XML 1.0 sense.  test/test_01.c
  contains a test that check different situations.

* [new] added new API to the axl doc module to get current stand alone
  document configuration:

    - axl_doc_get_standalone.

* [new] added new API to the axl node module:
   
    - axl_node_free
    - axl_node_is_empty

* [fix] fixing several bugs at axl_stream_inspect. Now any call to
  axl_stream_inspect that successfully find the element looked up, the
  stream will be accepted and move forward.

* [fix] fixing several bugs at axl_stream_inspect_several.

* [new] adding new API to axl stream module to check that a provided
  chunk contains a "white space" in the sense the XML 1.0 standard
  defines. Added also API to compare two chunks. A function to get
  current status for the stream is also added.
    
     - axl_stream_is_white_space
     - axl_stream_cmp
     - axl_stream_remains

* [new] adding a new module to perform console log reporting. API
  added:

     - AxlDebugLevel (enum definition)
     - axl_log_is_enabled
     - axl_log_color_is_enabled
     - axl_log

* [fix] fixing a bug in the AXL_CONSUME_SPACES which was causing to
  not properly detect when an error was found at the stream.

* [new] adding a new macro which allows to check if an string
  reference is empty either because it is NULL or it has no content.

     - AXL_IS_STR_EMTPY

* [fix,new] making axl_init function to return an bool rather than an
  int value. Added a new function to the axl module to terminate axl
  library function. Currently it doesn't make any operation. It is
  added for future use.

     - axl_end 

* [fix] making axl_error_new function to drop a critical log when it
  receives a initialization call. This saves the needed to write a
  console line instruction to report the error received.

  while reading the xml header.

* [new] LibAxl now completely read xml documents with one empty node
  and full header xml specification.

* [new] making LibAxl error reporting mechanism to report not only the
  error found but also the stream index, the stream size and a preview
  of the stream near to the error.  API added:

     - axl_stream_get_size
     - axl_stream_get_near_to

* [new] adding more deallocation code to release memory used by
  axlStream objects.

  creating them using the printf-like format. API added:

     - axl_stream_strdup
     - axl_stream_strdup_n
     - axl_stream_strdup_printf

* [fix] fixing axl_strdup macro definition to point to the
  axl_stream_strdup function.

  configure if the terminator matched should be accepted or not. API
  added:

    - axl_stream_get_untilv

* [new] implemented a string split operation, that is able to use
  several strings to split the result. Adding API to get current
  number of items inside the result returned and to release it.
   
    - axl_stream_split
    - axl_stream_freev
    - axl_stream_strv_num

  only xml node structure is implemented, <!ELEMENT
  declaration. Remains to implement <!ATTLIST declaration.  Great!!

* [fix] fixing LibAxl library to be able to parse huge xml files
  (using large.xml).  Added regression test to ensure this remains this
  way in the future.

  characters, separated by sequence or choice indicators.

* [fix] adding support to detect and validate DTD element item list
  that comes with element repetitions.

  node.

* [fix] making test file to run all test defined (disabled for initial
  DTD support).

* [fix] finally, DTD support for <!ELEMENT instruction is now
  complete. It includes support for any combination and nesting for
  sequence and choices, including repetition patterns.  Great!

* [fix] applying an internal change to the axl stream implementation
  to not allocate memory required for an array used to store the
  chunks to match inside the axl_stream_get_until function, making
  that allocation at the stream initialization code, reusing the same
  piece of memory between calls. This have improved LibAxl memory
  usage up to 36%!!!

* [fix] making LibAxl DTD parsing engine to detect and skip <!ENTITY
  declarations for now.

* [fix] making DTD nodes flagged as PCDATA to accept empty content.

* [fix] disabling top level root node check while performing DTD

  attribute for a given node. Added a new function to create empty xml
  documents (axlDoc reference).  Added initial implementation to
  support dumping an axlDoc reference into a flat xml
  representation. Also added a function to allow getting the node

  to ensure that automatic translation works for every release
  done. API added:
   
    - axl_node_get_content_trans
    - axl_node_attribute_get_value_trans

* [new] added support to performing XML document dumping from an
  structure into a string representation. The operation is done in an
  efficient way, allocating only one memory chunk, that was previously
  calculated. Added a test to ensure dumping functionally. API added:

    - axl_doc_dump

* [new] added a new function to allow comparing two XML
  documents. Also added a function to compare two nodes. API added:
   
    - axl_doc_are_equal
    - axl_node_are_equal

* [fix] fixing axl_stream_inspect_several to not report an error if
  there are more chunks left to be matched.

* [fix] several internal library improvements that have made the
  library to run a regression tests from 0.637ms to 0.106ms
  (GREAT!!!). LibXML do the same task in 0.047ms. Valgrind and
  Callgrind RULES!!

  Statistical progression data:

   *) Initial measure: 0.637ms

   1) After making some function to not call several times to strlen:
      [0.600ms]

   2) After making inspect several to not calculate every time chunk
      lengths: [0.565ms]

   3) After making get until function to not compare with white space
      strings: [0.435ms]

   4) After avoiding calling to getenv from axl_log_is_enabled:
      [0.262ms!!!]

   5) After rewriting AXL_CONSUME_SPACES to for an efficient version:
      [0.116ms!!!]

   6) After making a function, from inside the axl node module, to not
      call to initialize an internal list when it is known that the
      function will do nothing: [0.106!!!]

* [fix] fixing a bug left.

* [fix] general win32 makefiles update to remove previous references
  to libxml, replacing it with the new LibAxl implementation.

* [new] adding first initial web proposal for the LibAxl
  implementation.

* [fix] more updates for the LibAxl web page.

* [fix] uploading changes to make it work while building the axl dist.

* [new] adding initial memory report result.
