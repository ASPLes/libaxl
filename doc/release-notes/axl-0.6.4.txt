~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Minor stable release. Python Axl fixings, fixings at stream
  reader global index and API updates.

Changes from previous release 0.6.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Fixing PyAxl node deallocation caused by setting a node
  created inside a node created (with axl.Node). The last one do not
  disable its finish_on_gc. Added reg test py_test_05.

* [fix] making PyAxl node.remove () to flag internal node as null no
  matter which is the value of dealloc parameter.

* [fix] Adding some internal checks to PyAxl node to return None in
  case of internal NULL reference found.

* [new] Added new function to stream API to do efficient string
  replacement (including binary strings). API added:
 
    - axl_stream_replace

  Updated regression test (test_01_03) to check its function.

* [fix] Fixed bug at axl_stream_replace in case the replacement means
  a reduction. Updated reg test (test_01_03) to check this issue.

* [new] Added macro to do simple non-binary string replace. API added:

   - axl_replace

* [fix] Making axl_stream_replace to return source_len on NULL
  parameter.

* [fix] Fixed bug inside axl stream implementation which was not
  properly updating global index in the case the terminator was
  accepted.
