Changes from previous release 0.4.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

* [fix] Updated configure.ac file to include some parenthesis at
  INT_TO_PTR and PTR_TO_INT definitions.

* [new] Added a new function to perform case sensitive string
  comparison. API added:

   - axl_stream_casecmp

* [fix] Fixed bug inside axl_stream_trim and axl_stream_trim_with_size
  which was causing to read outside memory boundary with 0 length
  strings.

* [fix] Fixed another bug inside axl_stream_trim* functions which was
  causing to not properly handle the basic case where an empty content
  string is receive (a string that is totally trimed). Added
  regression test to check the bug.

* [fix] Fixed wrong <!DOCTYPE handling at the header. Added a
  regression test to check this bug in future releases.

* [new] Added a new function that allows to create a node from a
  complex content provided as argument. The function reads xml input
  and provides a reference to a axlNode. Added regression test to
  check the function.  API added:

   - axl_node_parse_strings

* [fix] Updated the library to nullify the axl root node at the axlDoc
  if the node is removed from the document. Added a regression test to
  check this.

* [new] Added a new function to create xml node content providing the
  xml inline content in a prinf-like format. Included regression test
  to check the function added. API added:

   - axl_node_parse

* [fix] Fixed a bug inside axl_node_set_is_empty function which wasn't
  clearing the node content if there were only one item to
  clear. Added regression test to check this in future releases.

* [fix] Fixed bug inside DTD validation engine, while handling nodes
  that have an #IMPLIED IDREF attribute not defined. Added regression
  test to check this in future releases.
