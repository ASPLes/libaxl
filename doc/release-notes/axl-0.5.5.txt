Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new Axl
Library release.

Axl Library is an small and efficient XML toolkit, written in ANSI C,
and released under the LGPL, that will allow you to produce efficient
and clear code that interfaces with XML data.

The library was produced to support XML requirements needed by
software developed by Advanced Software Production Line, S.L.

At this moment the library is being used by Vortex Library, Af-Arch,
Turbulence, Shaper and Fovap.

Changes from previous release 0.5.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] General modifications to Makefile.win files to use strip
  command to reduce resulting library size on Microsoft Windows
  platform.

* [fix] Updated documentation and updated axl_decl.h header to include
  old boolean definitions (bool type and false/true values) but only
  available if the application importing the API did no define
  __axl_disable_broken_bool_def__ and it is not a C++ user.

* [fix] More library boolean cleanups. Removing all references to
  false and true, replacing them with axl_false and axl_true.

* [fix] Applying change notification axl-bool-removal-02. Added new
  type (axl_bool) and its static values (axl_false and axl_true).
