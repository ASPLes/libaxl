Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new Axl
Library release.

Axl Library is a small and efficient XML toolkit, written in ANSI C,
with support for Python bindings and released under the LGPL. It
allows to produce efficient and clear code that handle XML data.

The library was produced to support XML requirements needed by
software developed by Advanced Software Production Line, S.L.

At this moment the library is being used by Vortex Library, Af-Arch,
Turbulence, Shaper, Fovap and Ju-Doc.

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Fixed some bugs, and improved memory handling at axl hash.

Changes from previous release 0.6.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Several modifications to properly produce debian packages for
  0.6.0 release (including python ones).

* [new] Updated PyAxl to include axl.version() which returns current
  PyAxl installed version.

* [fix] Fixed error string returned at dtd parsing to include more
  information.

* [fix] Making library to compile in the case no python devel headers
  are found..

* [fix] Fixed htmlize option which was not produce proper indentation
  when output was redirected to a file. Added initial scaffolding to
  run regression tests to check axl-knife function.

* [fix] Fixed another bug in axl-knife which was placing a node
  termination for a node that has no childs or content, inside htmlize
  function. Added reg test to check its function.

* [new] Updated axl-knife tool to allow configuring a CSS class for
  --htmlize option. Checked reg-test.

* [fix] Improving error message returned by DTD validation failure.

* [fix] Fixed axl-knife htmlize bug. Added regression test case to
  check fix introduced.

* [fix] Fixed missing CDATA support for --htmlize option..

* [fix] Adding missing flags to libaxl/Makefile.am

* [fix] Committing .def updates and version components..

* [fix] Improving DTD error reported when child content is bigger than
  expected.

* [fix] Moved function declarations axl_free, axl_alloc and
  axl_realloc to be included inside C_DECLS so windows platforms (c++
  compilers) can include it right.

* [fix] Fixed bug inside axl_node_set_attribute which was allowing to
  add the same attribute more than one time. Updated PyAxl
  implementation to remove and set the attribute in the case a set
  operation is requested. Added reg test test_45 to reproduce bug and
  check fix introduced.

* [new] Updated axl factory internals to implement optional spares
  support allowing to reuse nodes released (returned to the factory)
  which can be used later by next calls to axl_factory_get. API added:
   
   - axl_factory_release_spare
   - axl_factory_spare_max
   - axl_factory_spare_next

* [fix] Updated axlHash implementation to use new spare support from
  factory that allows reusing internal hash nodes, saving memory
  allocations in common insert/remove cycles (specially using same
  keys). Updated regression tests to check function and how it saves
  space (test_02_04_1).  Initial results shows a total amount of bytes
  allocated of 20,300 that now consumes 389 in a constant manner
  (assuming insert and removes keeps the hash under the same set of
  items).

* [fix] Updated PyAxl axl.Node.has_attr method to allow support
  providing the attribute value to check. Updated documentation.
