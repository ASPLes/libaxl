Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new Axl
Library release.

Axl Library is an small and efficient XML toolkit, written in ANSI C,
and released under the LGPL, that will allow you to produce efficient
and clear code that interfaces with XML data.

The library was produced to support XML requirements needed by
software developed by Advanced Software Production Line, S.L.

At this moment the library is being used by Vortex Library, Af-Arch,
Turbulence, Shaper and Fovap.

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Fixed prebuffering code exposed at the windows platform. Updated
  allocation API to ensure they aren't mixed. Properly implemented
  xml:space support, featuring a binary stack data structure which
  allows to implement the xml:space inheritance across child nodes in
  an efficient way. Updated axl list API to allow developers to remove
  by pointers. Other minor bugs fixed, included in the regression
  test and updated documentation.

Thanks to..
~~~~~~~~~~~

  Benoit Amiaux (provided really useful comments and patches to fix
  issues found). Kostis Mentzelos (reported the xml:space problem).

Change notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  None. 

Changes from previous release 0.4.12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Fixed bug inside axl stream prebuffering code, exposed while
  running regression tests inside the windows platform.

* [new] Added initial implementation to --htmlize inside the axl-knife
  which allows to prepare a xml document to be displayed as html using
  simple css.

* [new] Committing changes proposed by Benoit Amiaux to make axl_new
  and the realloc functions to be internally implemented as a function
  call opening the possibility to provide application defined
  allocation functions. API added:

   - axl_calloc
   - axl_realloc

* [fix] fixed documentation (wrong placed).

* [fix] Fixed wrong implementation for handling xml:space. Updated
  regression test to check fixes introduced for future releases
  (Reported by Kostis Mentzelos)

* [new] Introduced a new data structure to implement the proper
  xml:space handling, called Binary Stack, which allows to store
  boolean/binary states in an fast and memory efficient manner.
  Updated regression test to check its function. API added:

   - axl_binary_stack_new
   - axl_binary_stack_push
   - axl_binary_stack_push_the_same
   - axl_binary_stack_pop
   - axl_binary_stack_peek
   - axl_binary_stack_is_empty
   - axl_binary_stack_size
   - axl_binary_stack_free

* [fix] Updated regression test (axl list add/remove).

* [fix] More updates to the regression test.

* [new] Updated axl list API to include two new functions that allows
  to remove by pointer from a particular list (without using the equal
  function). Internal module problem reported by Benoit Amiaux. API
  added:

   - axl_list_remove_ptr
   - axl_list_unlink_ptr

* [fix] Updated documentation about axl_list_always_return_1 to warn
  that this function could cause problems while removing items. It is
  provided some information for its alternatives (axl_list_remove_ptr
  and axl_list_unlink_ptr).

* [fix] Updated axl_list_add to include a note about its relation with
  the equal function configured.

* [fix] Fixed missing nullification at the axl_stream_get_untilv_wide
  causing segfault on the next function call.

* [fix] Updated axl_stream_get_until_ref documentation to explain its
  nullification behavior and how its interacts with next calls. Added
  a check to enforce the stream size variable is provided.

* [new] Updated axl stream API to include a function that allows to
  move the current index. API added:

   - axl_stream_step
