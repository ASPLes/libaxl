This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Bug fix release. Added support to include any binary content based
  on <![CDATA[]]> decls by doing some automatic replacements.

Thanks to..
~~~~~~~~~~~

  Benoit Amiaux (reported and fixed BOM detection and other
  compilation warnings).

Changes from previous release 0.5.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [new] Added nested <![CDATA[]]> support by doing some particular
  entity substitutions. This will ensure that a xml document using
  CDATA decl can hold any binary data. Added support functions for
  additional operations around this feature. API added:

    - axl_node_has_invalid_chars_cdata
    - axl_node_content_copy_and_escape_cdata

  Added regression test (test_42).

* [fix] More regression test on axlList and NULL references.

* [fix] Making axl_list_remove, axl_list_remove_ptr,
  axl_list_remove_first and axl_list_remove_last to allow removing
  NULL reference. Updated regression test to check new function.

* [fix] Updating configure.ac to check requirements for exarg files
  included inside axl-knife to avoid using va_copy (or its draft
  version) __va_copy.

* [fix] Applying patches provided by Benoit Amiaux to fix minor
  compilation warnings and proper BOM utf-8 detection.

libaxl/knife:
* [new] Added new option to allow checking a xml document (--check-xml).

* [fix] Fixing exarg_strdup_printfv to get it compiled
  and working on windows. Updated associated projects
  using libexarg files.
