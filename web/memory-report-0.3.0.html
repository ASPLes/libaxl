<h2><img src="arrow.png" /> Axl memory usage report for 0.3.0 release</h2>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" />1. Introduction</h3>

<p>The following information was gathered through several modifications
performed to the LibAxl library, using a machine with a Intel(R) Pentium(R)
4. This report covers the memory profile that the library has and compares
that result with the LibXML library. </p>

<p>In also contains a brief about improvements done to the library to
reduce its execution time, memory pairs allocation and memory usage,
while supporting the same features.</p>

<p>It is in no way a complete library comparison at all, but provides
some useful information about the motivations for building LibAxl
library and how basic features compares to LibXML.</p>

<p>The implementation reference chosen was <a
href="http://www.xmlsoft.org">LibXML-2.0 (version 2.6.26)</a> mainly
because it was used by <a
href="http://fact.aspl.es">Af-Arch</a> and <a
href="http://vortex.aspl.es">Vortex Library</a>.

<p>To produce the memory profiling results showed in this report it
was used the <a href="http://www.valgrind.org">valgrind</a> tool and
its extension to profile heap allocation and memory performance,
called <b>massif</b>. It was also used the <b>callgrind</b> tool which
gives statistical performance information.</p>

<p>The test used for this memory usage report was the following for
the case of Axl library results:</p>

<pre class="code">
#include <axl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
	axlError ** error;

	/* top level definitions */
	axlDoc * doc = NULL;

	/* initialize axl library */
	if (! axl_init ()) {
		printf ("Unable to initialize Axl library\n");
		return -1;
	}

	/* get current doc reference */
	doc = axl_doc_parse_from_file ("large.xml", error);
	if (doc == NULL)
		return -1;

	/* release the document */
	axl_doc_free (doc);

  	/* cleanup axl library */
	axl_end ();

	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>For the performance results get for the LibXML-2.0 library, the
test code was:</p>

<pre class="code">
#include <libxml/parser.h>
#include <libxml/xmlmemory.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
	
	xmlDocPtr     doc;

	/* init libXml */
	LIBXML_TEST_VERSION
	
	/* load the document */
	doc = xmlParseFile ("large.xml");
	if (doc == NULL) {
		printf ("Failed to load the xml document.\n");
		return -1;
	}

	/* release memory */
	xmlFreeDoc (doc);

	xmlCleanupParser();

	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>The xml file used is a glade file definition that is 650K sized
approx (found inside the test directory bundle with the source code:
large.xml). </p>

<p>Test was run using the following command to get memory usage:</p>

<pre class="code">
  bash: ~$ valgrind --leak-check --show-reachable=yes ./test_file
</pre>

<p>The following command was used to get the memory profiling
information for both libraries.</p>

<pre class="code">
 bash: ~$ valgrind --tool=massif ./test_file
</pre>


<p>Conventions used on this report to identify memory allocations,
memory deallocations and total amount of memory used are the
following:</p>

<pre class="code">
  (A) = allocations (number of request to the memory system)
  (F) = deallocations (number of times memory requested was returned)
  (T) = total amount of memory allocated (in bytes)
</pre>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 2. Initial status</h3>

<p>Before starting we are going to remember previous performance state
covered by the following report: <a
href="memory-report-0.2.6.html">for Axl Library 0.2.6</a>, that shows the
following data as initial status for memory consumption and runtime
performance.

<pre class="code">
 MEMORY CONSUMED BY AXL 0.2.6:

 LibAxl:
 (A) 106,208 (F) 106,208 (T) 1,513,687

 LibXML:
 (A) 127,811 (F) 127,811 (T) 4,201,777
</pre>

<pre class="code">
  RUNTIME PERFORMANCE BY AXL 0.2.6:

  test_01a (axl): 0.077ms
  test_01b (xml): 0.047ms
</pre>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 3. Improve operations performed</h3>

<p>This new release includes support for memory allocation factory, a
simple implementation to alloc regions of memory that contains element
for the same type (memory size), that are requested allocating bigger
blocks, reducing the number of memory allocs and deallocs
performed. </p>

<p>This technique not only improves program execution, but also reduce
administrative memory used by the system to manage memory allocated by
the program on the heap. </p>

<p>Previous Axl Library releases was suffering this problem: its
allocation pattern was making the system to hold more memory to manage
memory allocated by the application than the memory allocated by the
application itself. </p>

<p>Looking at the following memory profiling result, for the Axl
Library 0.2.1 release, it is clearly showed: the library was requiring
less memory than the heap-admin required by the system to manage such
memory: </p>

<img src="massif.5610.png" />

<p>In the next section it is showed the radical change performed due to
introducing the factory memory allocation. </p>

<p>After doing changes described, we can say that Axl Library is now
faster than LibXML, using the test reference described. Here are the
result for the run time execution:</p>

<pre class="code">
  RUNTIME PERFORMANCE BY AXL 0.3.0:

  test_01a (axl): 0.043ms
  test_01b (xml): 0.050ms
</pre>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 4. Memory consumption</h3>

<p>Memory allocation through the factory has improved the overall
library performance, for its measured elements: allocations
operations and memory heap admin used.</p>

<p>Here are the exceptional results that shows Axl Library execution
against results obtained with LibXML.</p>

<pre class="code">
 MEMORY CONSUMED BY AXL 0.3.0:

 LibAxl:
 (A) 2,076 (F) 2,076 (T) 1,678,824

 LibXML:
 (A) 127,811 (F) 127,811 (T) 4,201,777
</pre>

<p>Here is the memory profile (produced with massif) for the LibXML
library:</p>

<img src="report-image-0.3.0-02.png" />

<p>And the memory profile for the Axl Library:</p>

<img src="report-image-0.3.0-01.png" />

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 4. Conclusion</h3>

<p>Conclusions are pretty clear: Axl Library has improved its memory
allocation pattern, not only reducing its memory allocations requests,
but also reducing its heap memory admin. This has also improved
library efficient to make it, for the first time, faster than LibXML
(around <b>14% faster</b>). </p>

<p>At the same time, the library keeps on consuming around <b>2.5
times</b> less than LibXML for the same document which makes it really
memory efficient.</p>
