<h2><img src="arrow.png" /> Axl memory usage report for 0.2.5 release</h2>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" />1. Introduction</h3>

<p>The following information was gathered through several modifications
performed to the LibAxl library, using a machine with a Intel(R) Pentium(R)
4. This report covers the memory profile that the library has and compares
that result with the LibXML library. </p>

<p>In also contains a brief about improvements done to the library to
reduce execution time, while supporting the same features.</p>

<p>It is in no way a complete library comparison at all, but provides
some useful information about the motivations for building LibAxl
library and how basic features compares to LibXML.</p>

<p>The implementation reference chosen was <a
href="http:/www.xmlsoft.org">LibXML-2.0 (version 2.6.26)</a> mainly
because it was used by <a
href="http://fact.aspl.es">Af-Arch</a> and <a
href="http://vortex.aspl.es">Vortex Library</a>.

<p>To produce the memory profiling results used on this report it was
used the <a href="http://www.valgrind.org">valgrind</a> tool and its
extension to profile heap allocation and memory performance, called
<b>massif</b>. It was also used <b>callgrind</b> tool which gives
statistical performance information.</p>

<p>The test used for this memory usage report was the following for
the case of Axl library results:</p>

<pre class="code">
#include <axl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
	axlError ** error;

	/* top level definitions */
	axlDoc * doc = NULL;

	/* initialize axl library */
	if (! axl_init ()) {
		printf ("Unable to initialize Axl library\n");
		return -1;
	}

	/* get current doc reference */
	doc = axl_doc_parse_from_file ("large.xml", error);
	if (doc == NULL)
		return -1;

	/* release the document */
	axl_doc_free (doc);

  	/* cleanup axl library */
	axl_end ();

	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>For the performance results get for the LibXML-2.0 library, the
test code was:</p>

<pre class="code">
#include <libxml/parser.h>
#include <libxml/xmlmemory.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
	
	xmlDocPtr     doc;

	/* init libXml */
	LIBXML_TEST_VERSION
	
	/* load the document */
	doc = xmlParseFile ("large.xml");
	if (doc == NULL) {
		printf ("Failed to load the xml document.\n");
		return -1;
	}

	/* release memory */
	xmlFreeDoc (doc);

	xmlCleanupParser();

	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>The xml file used is a glade file definition that is 650K sized
approx. </p>

<p>Test was run using the following command to get memory usage:</p>

<pre class="code">
  bash: ~$ valgrind --leak-check --show-reachable=yes ./test_file
</pre>

<p>The following command was used to get the memory profiling
information for both libraries.</p>

<pre class="code">
 bash: ~$ valgrind --tool=massif ./test_file
</pre>


<p>Conventions used on this report to identify memory allocations,
memory deallocations and total amount of memory used are the
following:</p>

<pre class="code">
  (A) = allocations
  (F) = deallocations
  (T) = total amount (bytes)
</pre>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 2. Initial status</h3>

<p>Last <a href="memory-usage-report-17-04-2006.html">report done</a>,
for Axl Library 0.2.1, shows the following data as initial status for
memory consumption and runtime performance.

<pre class="code">
 MEMORY CONSUMED BY AXL 0.2.1:

 LibAxl:
 (A) 139088 (F) 139088 (T) 1937471

 LibXML:
 (A) 127809 (F) 127809 (T) 4201679
</pre>

<pre class="code">
  RUNTIME PERFORMANCE BY AXL 0.2.1:

  test_01a (axl): 0.106ms
  test_01b (xml): 0.047ms
</pre>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 3. Improve operations performed</h3>

<p>Initially, it was tried to implement a stream indexer allowing a
fast access to items search on the input stream while doing xml
parsing. </p>

<p>Although the result was good enough as an starting point, memory
consumption was fired up. This excessive memory consumption makes us to
drop this alternative as a way to improve library efficiency. </p>

<p>Then, as a side effect, we found that memcmp operation was
extremely inefficient, not by itself, but because the function
provides a functionality not required, throwing unexpected consumption
results. The function returns how many bytes differs both strings
while the required feature mostly required by Axl is to only now if
they are equal.</p>

<p>After writing a particular function to perform this job, axl_cmp,
the following results was gathered:</p>

<pre class="code">
  RUNTIME PERFORMANCE BY AXL 0.2.5:

  test_01a (axl): 0.083ms
  test_01b (xml): 0.050ms
</pre>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 4. Memory consumption</h3>

<p>Additionally, several modifications have been applied to the
library, mostly to support the mixed API. After doing some
optimization, memory consumption found is:</p>

<pre class="code">
 MEMORY CONSUMED BY AXL 0.2.5:

 LibAxl:
 (A) 130,146 (F) 130,146 (T) 1,890,427

 LibXML:
 (A) 127,811 (F) 127,811 (T) 4,201,777
</pre>

<p>Here is the memory profile (produced with massif) for the LibXML
library:</p>

<img src="report-image-0.2.5-01.png" />

<p>And the memory profile for the Axl Library:</p>

<img src="report-image-0.2.5-02.png" />

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 4. Conclusion</h3>

<p>This new Axl Library release is faster than previous, reducing
execution time from <b>0.106ms</b> to <b>0.83ms</b>, while keeping
memory usage low. In fact, this release have also reduced memory
consumption from <b>1,937,471 bytes</b> to <b>1,890,427 bytes</b>.</p>

<p>LibXML is still faster, but consumes far more memory than Axl
Library. Memory profiling still shows that Axl Library performs
several little allocations, making the heap admin to be bigger than
the produced by LibXML.</p>
