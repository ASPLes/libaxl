<h2><img src="arrow.png" /> Axl memory usage report, evolution until 0.2.1</h2>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" />1. Introduction</h3>

<p>The following information was gathered through several modifications
performed to the LibAxl library, using a machine with a Intel(R) Pentium(R)
4. This report covers the memory profile that the library has and compares
that result with the LibXML library. </p>

<p>In also contains a brief about improvements done to the library to
reduce execution time, while supporting the same features.</p>

<p>It is in no way a complete library comparison at all, but provides
some useful information about the motivations for building LibAxl
library and how basic features compares to LibXML.</p>

<p>The implementation reference chosen was <a
href="http://www.xmlsoft.org">LibXML-2.0</a> mainly because it is the
one being used until now within the <a
href="http://fact.aspl.es">Af-Arch</a> and the <a
href="http://vortex.aspl.es">Vortex Library</a> projects.

<p>To produce the memory profiling results used on this report it was
used the <a href="http://www.valgrind.org">valgrind</a> tool and its
extension to profile heap allocation and memory performance, called
<b>massif</b>. It was also used <b>callgrind</b> tool which gives
statistical performance information.</p>

<p>The test used for this memory usage report was the following for
the case of Axl library results:</p>

<pre class="code">
#include <axl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
	axlError ** error;

	/* top level definitions */
	axlDoc * doc = NULL;

	/* initialize axl library */
	if (! axl_init ()) {
		printf ("Unable to initialize Axl library\n");
		return -1;
	}

	/* get current doc reference */
	doc = axl_doc_parse_from_file ("large.xml", error);
	if (doc == NULL)
		return -1;

	/* release the document */
	axl_doc_free (doc);

  	/* cleanup axl library */
	axl_end ();

	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>For the performance results get for the LibXML-2.0 library, the
test code was:</p>

<pre class="code">
#include <libxml/parser.h>
#include <libxml/xmlmemory.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
	
	xmlDocPtr     doc;

	/* init libXml */
	LIBXML_TEST_VERSION
	
	/* load the document */
	doc = xmlParseFile ("large.xml");
	if (doc == NULL) {
		printf ("Failed to load the xml document.\n");
		return -1;
	}

	/* release memory */
	xmlFreeDoc (doc);

	xmlCleanupParser();

	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>The xml file used is a glade file definition that is 650K sized
approx. </p>

<p>Test was run using the following command to get memory usage:</p>

<pre class="code">
  bash: ~$ valgrind --leak-check --show-reachable=yes ./test_file
</pre>

<p>The following command was used to get the memory profiling
information for both libraries.</p>

<pre class="code">
 bash: ~$ valgrind --tool=massif ./test_file
</pre>


<p>Conventions used on this report to identify memory allocations,
memory deallocations and total amount of memory used are the
following:</p>

<pre class="code">
  (A) = allocations
  (F) = deallocations
  (T) = total amount (bytes)
</pre>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 2. Initial status</h3>

<p>Once the library reached its base features, XML parsing and DTD
validation for a enough big validation data set, initial report to get
current memory usage and memory consumption for the Axl Library without
any modification was the following:</p>

<img src="massif.11755.png" />

Memory consumption for this initial state is was:


<pre class="code">
 (A) 273629 (F) 273629 (T) 3554854
</pre>

<p>Doing the same test to the total amount of memory used by LibXML to
parse and release the same file, results was:</p>

<pre class="code">
 (A) 127809 (F) 127809 (T) 4201679
</pre>

<p>Being its memory profile the following graphic:</p>

<img src="massif.5012.png" />


<p>As starting point conclusion we have found the following issues to be considered:</p>

<ul class="list">
  
  <li>LibXML is an implementation that is unbelievable fast. At the
moment this report was generated, we can ensure it could be the faster
xml parser available today.

  </li>

  <li>Initial profiling results shows that Axl library is slower than
LibXML, but, its memory consumption is lower.

  </li>

  <li>The <b>"head-admin"</b> limit shows how many administration
memory blocks was allocated to control the memory required by the
program. When a program request memory, an admin block is associated
to it (for memory administration purposes).

   <p>The graphic shows that LibAxl requires more heap admin blocks
  than LibXML. This is not a good symptom (explained below).</p>
  </li>

</ul>

<p>Previous graphs shows that LibAxl library allocates less memory but
with more small operations than LibXML. This is not good because
allocating several small pieces of memory is more inefficient than
allocation fewer but bigger, mainly because it is required, for the
same total amount of memory allocated, more administration memory
(<b>"heap-admin"</b>).</p>


<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 3. Improving the library memory efficiency</h3>

<p>Before seeing this results, it was applied a modification to the
library to avoid double allocations/deallocations, produced by
functions that were receiving a chunk already allocated, and then making
another copy. </p>

<p>Before applying this initial patch, results was the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
 (A) 212650 (F) 212650 (T) 3123296
</pre>

<img src="massif.8755.png" />

<p>Now the library perform, for the same task, supporting the same
features, up to 60000 fewer allocations/deallocations operations,
consuming around 3,1 megabytes.</p>

<p>After analyze current implementation it was detected that some
function, especially axl_stream_get_until was allocating memory that
was returned as a reference that could be usable from the user space,
but the axl stream implementation was forcing the user space to
perform a new allocation to get a copy. </p>

<p>After modifying the library, adding a new API to allow the axl
stream to nullify the reference returned so the user space could be
the only owner for the memory returned. </p>

<p>New test results was:</p>

<pre class="code">
 (A) 199962 (F) 199962 (T) 3014631
</pre>

<img src="massif.13488.png" />

<p>On this case, memory usage improvement was not so great. </p>

<p>Then a new change was applied to the axl_stream_get_until function,
which was creating an array, to iterate the chunk set to match, to later
free it. After making the library to create for each stream this
structured and deallocate it once the stream is destroyed, results got
was: </p>

<pre class="code">
 (A) 139088 (F) 139088 (T) 1937471
</pre>

<img src="massif.1980.png" />

<p>The change applied was really great, now the library was under the
2 megabyte limit and memory pairs produced was similar to the LibXML
library. </p>

<p>However, the heap-admin is still proportional bigger than the
useful memory allocated (in fact is the bigger memory segment
producing memory allocations).</p>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 4. Speeding up library execution time</h3>

<p>We have observer how the library execution time have evolved from
its initial measures (45000ms >>) to (16000ms >>)). This improvement
is mainly based on the concept that requiring memory from the kernel
makes the program slower. </p>

<p>Common causes making a program to be more slower as it requires
more memory are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Requiring memory from the system, without using a memory cache
  system or an object cache system, makes the system really
  inefficient because malloc operations are extremely
  inefficient.

  <p><a href="http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/multiproc/multiproc.html">[Attardi, Nadgir]</a> shows us how this memory allocator works
  compared with several memory allocators, and it keeps on getting
  worst if the program is multi-thread.</p></li>

  <li>The more memory requires a program the bigger are the
  probabilities of being sent (the entire or) some segment of the
  program pages to the swap memory, causing strong delays.

  <p>This shows us that a program should consume as low memory as
possible, improving the overall system performance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>


<p>So, at this pointer we could say that memory consumption could be
improved (yes, even more!!) but now it is time to focus on timing
issues. </p>

<p>We started with some initial measures using the <b>time</b> command
to check how fast were both test and here was the initial results:</p>

<pre class="code">
  test_01a (axl): 0.637ms
  test_01b (xml): 0.047ms
</pre>

<p>Wow!! Ok, this is not a surprise, we have stated at the begin of this
report that the LibXML library was really efficient doing its
job. </p>

<p>We started to use <b>callgrind</b> tool to check were was
inverted cpu time while running axl test and we found several
issues. Here is a list of improvements and its associated time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>After making some function to not call several times to strlen,
  but cache those values to be used not only in the function itself but
  all functions called from it:<br>
      <b>[0.600ms]</b></li>
  <li>After making inspect several to not calculate every time chunk
      lengths, but cache those lengths to be used over and over again: <br>
      <b>[0.565ms]</b></li>
  <li>After making get until function to not compare with white space strings: <br>
      <b>[0.435ms]</b></li>
  <li>After avoiding calling to getenv from axl_log_is_enabled, and
      make the first call to be cached: <br>
      <b>[0.262ms!!!]</b><br>
      
      We have to say here that this wasn't expected. A simple call to
      the system call getenv was causing the overall system to have
      a performance impact of 200ms!!!
      </li>
  <li>After rewriting AXL_CONSUME_SPACES to have an efficient implementation: <br>
      <b>[0.116ms!!!]</b></li>

      Well, at this point we have to say that things started to get interesting.
      
  <li>After making a function, from inside the axl node module, to not call to
      initialize an internal list when it is known that the function will do nothing:<br>
      <b>[0.106!!!]</b></li>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The result was that, before making some investigation, the library
was performing its job, passing all its validation test but doing it
<b>6 times faster than before!!</b>.

<p>To summarize both results, memory and execution time improvements,
here is the memory profile result:</p>

<img src="massif.5610.png" />

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 4. Conclusion</h3>

<p>This reports shows initial state of the XML 1.0 implementation and
how it was modified to get better performance results.</p>

<p>These results
was mainly compared with LibXML because it is an implementation
reference, it is really fast doing its job and was the library being
used by internal projects at <a href="http://www.aspl.es">ASPL</a>.</p>

<p>At the end, before doing all modifications, the LibAxl library is
really efficient while using memory and can be better. A final
comparison is the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
 LibAxl:
 (A) 139088 (F) 139088 (T) 1937471

 LibXML:
 (A) 127809 (F) 127809 (T) 4201679
</pre>

<p>It also shows how the LibXML is still faster than LibAxl for XML
parsing functions. This could be improved as memory consumption is
improved and the new object cache system <a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/bos94/bonwick.html">[Bonwick]</a> is deployed into
the LibAxl.</p>

<pre class="code">
  test_01a (axl): 0.106ms
  test_01b (xml): 0.047ms
</pre>
