    Change Id: axl-bool-removal-02
 Project name: Axl library
  Included in: 0.5.5
       Status: NOTIFY
       Author: Francis Brosnan Bl√°zquez

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

Previous change notification (axl-bool-removal-01) did not fully solve
the problem that motivated the change. This is because, still taking
the source code and compiling it with a C++ tool, leaves to having
unexpected results with internal false and true values used.

Change Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) The library will have a boolean representation defined as
   axl_bool. This type is fully compatible with bool type previously
   defined until 0.5.3.

2) "false" and "true" definitions are replaced by axl_false and
   axl_true definitions. 

3) All functions receiving or returning bool values now receive or
   return axl_bool

Solution to incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

C users: In the case false and true definitions imported from Axl
         Library are used, the must be replaced with axl_false and
         axl_true. It is also possible to move the responsibility of
         this definition to the application using Axl Library by
         defining the following:

         #define false ((int)0)
         #define true  ((int)1)

         However this is not recommended since this is in fact a
         definition that causes interactions not only with C++
         compiler but also with C compilers that may only support C99
         standard.

c++ users: they won't need to use wrappers around functions using bool
           type from Axl Library for newly written code. For wrappers
           already written, they will still work since the Axl Library
           API is expecting int as in previous releases.

           This change notification revision improves previous one by
           allowing C++/C users to use axl_bool type and its static
           values axl_false and axl_true with no problem.
