Couplet1 :


What if the light drives you insane
It’s spinin round around my head 	

Forgetin’ time…

Is it so hard to understand
Swearin’ to god that we won't change


And if I fall, will you heal me? 
And if I lose, will you help me? 
Change your mind, will you maybe…

Surrender   


Couplet2 :

Lift me up beyond the crowd          
What’s this sound I heard so loud

I know…the shining of your eyes
I know… the silence of my pride
I know my heart will probably….

Surrender

Last good bye in time
