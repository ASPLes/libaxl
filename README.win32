1. Intro
~~~~~~~~

  There are two know ways to compile LibAxl under windows: using gcc
tools, provided by the mingw project [1] or using one of the Microsoft
C compilers. 

  In any case, you must take into consideration these basic steps for
both:

  1) You must create an axl_config.h file, using the
     axl_config_win32.h file provided. Just rename it. 

  2) If you are using Microsoft C compilers, you must ensure you can
     have access to the _vscprintf function or not. If you can, which
     is the recomended, you must define a preprocessor as follows:
  
        HAVE_VSCPRINTF

     See axl_stream_vprintf_len function inside the axl_stream.c
     module to get a more accurate idea.

     If you can't get access to such function (which is relatively
     recent), just do nothing. This will make Axl Library to use
     default implementation for the axl_stream_strdup* family of
     functions to be limited to 8192 bytes. 

     In many cases this isn't a problem, but you are adviced.

2. GCC and Mingw
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This is default platform we are using to get LibAxl working under
windows. It is showed to get really good results and good performance,
however there is a problem. Gcc tools do not produce a debug
information format that could be used by Microsoft tools. 

  Obviously, if this is not a problem for you, then you don't have any
problem, and, under this situation we recomend to use gcc as default
compilation tool.

  You can use files provided inside the src, ns and test directory to
compile Axl: Makefile.win

3. Microsoft compilers

  Axl library is tested to compile and run properly using Visual C 6.0,
Visual Studio 2005 and its express edition.

  With the source code are provided visual studio project files to
make it easy to compile LibAxl. See libaxl.sln under the top source
directory.

4. Testing build done

  Whatever you compiler is, you must execute the test_01 regression
test, found inside the test directory to ensure your build will
provide a proper function. All tests must be passed.
