    Change Id: axl-hash-remove-01
 Project name: Axl library
  Included in: 0.5.0
       Status: NOTIFY
       Author: Francis Brosnan Bl√°zquez

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

A minimal change to the axl hash remove API is required to get a
notification if the item requested to be removed, was found in the
hash during the operation.

Change Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following function will now return (bool). They was previously
returning (void):

  - axl_hash_remove
  - axl_hash_delete


Solution to incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no especial expected action to be taken. If the developer
requires to know if the item was removed, update the code as
appropriate.

Some compilers might complain due to not using the data returned by
the function.
