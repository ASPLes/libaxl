<h2><img src="arrow.png" /> Axl memory usage report for 0.2.6 release</h2>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" />1. Introduction</h3>

<p>The following information was gathered through several modifications
performed to the LibAxl library, using a machine with a Intel(R) Pentium(R)
4. This report covers the memory profile that the library has and compares
that result with the LibXML library. </p>

<p>In also contains a brief about improvements done to the library to
reduce execution time, while supporting the same features.</p>

<p>It is in no way a complete library comparison at all, but provides
some useful information about the motivations for building LibAxl
library and how basic features compares to LibXML.</p>

<p>The implementation reference chosen was <a
href="http:/www.xmlsoft.org">LibXML-2.0 (version 2.6.26)</a> mainly
because it was used by <a
href="http://fact.aspl.es">Af-Arch</a> and <a
href="http://vortex.aspl.es">Vortex Library</a>.

<p>To produce the memory profiling results used on this report it was
used the <a href="http://www.valgrind.org">valgrind</a> tool and its
extension to profile heap allocation and memory performance, called
<b>massif</b>. It was also used <b>callgrind</b> tool which gives
statistical performance information.</p>

<p>The test used for this memory usage report was the following for
the case of Axl library results:</p>

<pre class="code">
#include <axl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
	axlError ** error;

	/* top level definitions */
	axlDoc * doc = NULL;

	/* initialize axl library */
	if (! axl_init ()) {
		printf ("Unable to initialize Axl library\n");
		return -1;
	}

	/* get current doc reference */
	doc = axl_doc_parse_from_file ("large.xml", error);
	if (doc == NULL)
		return AXL_FALSE;

	/* cleanup axl library */
	axl_end ();

	/* release the document */
	axl_doc_free (doc);

	return AXL_TRUE;
}
</pre>

<p>For the performance results get for the LibXML-2.0 library, the
test code was:</p>

<pre class="code">
#include <libxml/parser.h>
#include <libxml/xmlmemory.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
	
	xmlDocPtr     doc;

	/* init libXml */
	LIBXML_TEST_VERSION
	
	/* load the document */
	doc = xmlParseFile ("large.xml");
	if (doc == NULL) {
		printf ("Failed to load the xml document.\n");
		return -1;
	}

	/* release memory */
	xmlFreeDoc (doc);

	xmlCleanupParser();

	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>The xml file used is a glade file definition that is 650K sized
approx. </p>

<p>Test was run using the following command to get memory usage:</p>

<pre class="code">
  bash: ~$ valgrind --leak-check --show-reachable=yes ./test_file
</pre>

<p>The following command was used to get the memory profiling
information for both libraries.</p>

<pre class="code">
 bash: ~$ valgrind --tool=massif ./test_file
</pre>


<p>Conventions used on this report to identify memory allocations,
memory deallocations and total amount of memory used are the
following:</p>

<pre class="code">
  (A) = allocations
  (F) = deallocations
  (T) = total amount (bytes)
</pre>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 2. Initial status</h3>

<p>Last <a href="memory-usage-report-17-04-2006.html">report done</a>,
for Axl Library 0.2.1, shows the following data as initial status for
memory consumption and runtime performance.

<pre class="code">
 MEMORY CONSUMED BY AXL 0.2.1:

 LibAxl:
 (A) 139088 (F) 139088 (T) 1937471

 LibXML:
 (A) 127809 (F) 127809 (T) 4201579
</pre>

<pre class="code">
  RUNTIME PERFORMANCE BY AXL 0.2.1:

  test_01a (axl): 0.106ms
  test_01b (xml): 0.047ms
</pre>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 3. Improve operations performed</h3>

<p>An adaptative approach has been implemented to hold xml node
attributes using a simple linked list which shows a good performance
while it is memory efficient, and a hash table when those attributes
gets bigger than 10 attributes. </p>

<p>This modification was applied knowing that using a hash table to
handle attributes indexed by string keys is the best approach because
it offers good performance. However to be able take advantage of using
a hash table, many attributes must be stored. </p>

<p>In the other hand, using a simple linked list to hold attributes
while they are a small set (less or equal to 10 elements) shows that
it is faster and more memory efficient than using a hash table for
such situations.</p>

<p>The explanation is quite simple. Using a hash which implements key
collisions using <b>Chaining</b>, that has been showed to be the
better approach, makes to to resolve the hashing function plus iterate
over a list of elements which contains all clashed elements
(<b>Chaining</b>) with same hash value.</p>

<p>At the end, replacing a simple linked list with a hash for all
situations, have showed that it offers poor performance (because users
usually doesn't store 100 xml attributes for a particular node) and
poor memory usage (keep running a hash table is cost expensive than a
simple linked list).</p>

<p>Results compared to previous values shows that this is a better
approach. </p>

<pre class="code">
  RUNTIME PERFORMANCE BY AXL 0.2.5:

  test_01a (axl): 0.076ms
  test_01b (xml): 0.050ms
</pre>

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 4. Memory consumption</h3>

<p>Due to use a simple linked list for situations where few attributes
are used, shows that the library has a better memory usage:</p>

<pre class="code">
 MEMORY CONSUMED BY AXL 0.2.6:

 LibAxl:
 (A) 106,208 (F) 106,208 (T) 1,513,687

 LibXML:
 (A) 127,811 (F) 127,811 (T) 4,201,777
</pre>

<p>Here is the memory profile (produced with massif) for the LibXML
library:</p>

<img src="report-image-0.2.6-01.png" />

<p>And the memory profile for the Axl Library:</p>

<img src="report-image-0.2.6-02.png" />

<h3><img src="arrow.png" /> 4. Conclusion</h3>

<p>Again, this new Axl Library release is faster and more memory
efficient than previous, while all features keep the same (and new
ones are added).</p>

<p>Memory usage have been moved from <b>1,890,427 bytes</b> to
<b>1,513,687 bytes</b> and performance execution from <b>0.83ms</b> to
<b>0.77ms</b>.</p>

<p>LibXML is still faster, but consumes far more memory than Axl
Library. Memory profiling still shows that Axl Library performs
several little allocations, making the heap admin to be bigger than
the produced by LibXML.</p>

<p>However, at this point, it is possible to conclude that under heavy
memory pressure LibAxl will behave better as it requires fewer memory
to hold the same xml document structure. This has a clear impact while
developing xml applications where suffering swapping is a big
problem (part of the memory holding the program is sent to the swap
memory because memory load).</p>
