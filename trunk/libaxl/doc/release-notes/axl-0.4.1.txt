Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new Axl
Library release.

Axl Library is an small and efficient XML toolkit, that will allow you
to produce efficient and clear code that interfaces with XML data.

The library was produced to support XML requirements needed by
software developed by Advanced Software Production Line, S.L. 

At this moment the library is being used by Vortex Library,
Af-Arch, Shaper and Fovap.

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  Bug fixes, added missing files and new functions implemented.

Changes from previous release 0.4.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

* [fix] Committing missing file for the namespace library
  (libaxl-ns.def).

* [fix] General updates to the Makefile.win infrastructure to make Axl
  library to be compiled under windows.

* [fix] Making content enclosed by <![CDATA[..]]> declarations to be
  flagged as is while reading xml documents.

* [fix] added const declarations to axl_stream_to_upper_copy and
  axl_stream_to_lower_copy.

* [fix] Updated documentation for
  axl_node_annotate_get_int/string/double to include a reference to the
  default value returned if the key provided doesn't exists.

* [fix] Added more documentation to annotate functions describing that
  annotating double/int/string values, without using the proper
  function, will lead to unpredictable results.

* [fix] Added casting to the axl_factory_get function to make VC to
  not complain (Reported and Fixed by Thomas Unterleitner).

* [fix] Included support o calculate how many bytes will hold a
  printf-like format going to be used with vsnprintf function,
  allowing to also support platform that provides a broken
  implementation which just returns -1 if provided a NULL buffer
  (expecting to receive the amount of memory required to allocate,
  like GNU/Linux platform does). This fixes Microsoft Windows
  compilation with VC and VS compiler. Internal API implemented:

    - axl_stream_vprintf_len
    - axl_stream_printf_len

   Previous will only be used as a fall back when no vasprintf is available in
   the platform and the vsnprintf function return -1 if it is requested to
   return the size to allocate). Added comprehensive tests to ensure previous
   functions provided the proper values.

* [fix] Making axl_node_set_cdata_content to use memcpy instructions to produce
  better performance.

* [fix] Fixed bugs at axl_error_new function.

* [fix] Added some documentation to the axl_list_new and update
  Makefile.win to include the new flag used by the library (-lm).

* [fix] Adding math library link flag to the pkg-config file.

* [fix] Added an internal definition to support long long type inside
  visual studio and making axl_stream_vprintf_len to not return -1 if
  an null argument is found.

* [fix] Committing an update to the axl_log to make it compilable from
  visual c.

* [fix] Updating export symbols file (.def) for windows.

* [new] Committing files to compile LibAxl using visual studio express
  2005 (libaxl, libaxl-ns and test). Checked all tests runs properly.
cd d
* [fix] Fixed bugs inside the axl_strdup_printf family of functions.

* [fix] making axl_stream_vprintf_len to use _vscprintf under windows
  platform if not used gcc as compiler.

* [fix] Updates to visual studio solution definition.

* [fix] Updating autoconf files to include visual studio files. 

* [fix] Making axl_stream_vprintf_len to support a fallback method if
  not found _vscprintf in the windows platform. To activate it use:
  AXL_USE_VPRINTF_LEN.

* [fix] Detecting if _vscprintf is available while compiling axl on
  windows platform, and using an alternative method.

* [fix] More fixings to make axl to be compilable with Visual C 6.0

* [fix] Fixed some constant declarations.

* [fix] Committing general instructions to make Axl library to be
  compiled under windows (added to the extra dist set).

* [new] Added a new function to expose an internal API that allows to
  escape xml invalid chars (&, <, >, ' and "). API added:

  - axl_node_content_copy_and_escape

* [new] Added a new function which allows to configure a new node
  child for a parent and brother of a reference node provided:

  - axl_node_set_child_after
