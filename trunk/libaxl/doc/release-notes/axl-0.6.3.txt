allows to produce efficient and clear code that handle XML data.

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Many updates to PyAxl API to include new functions, fix memory
  allocation problems and documentation updates.

  General updates to check all allocation operations to fail
  gracefully.


Changes from previous release 0.6.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Updates in configure.ac to better detect vasprintf function
  when available.

* [fix] Updated PyAxl node API to include replace, deattach and
  set_child_after

* [fix] Including PyUnicode_SetDefaultEncoding to be set to UTF-8.

* [fix] Making axl.Node.remove method to clean its internal reference
  to the node when it was requested to finish the C reference.

* [fix] Minor changes to produce debian packages for 0.6.2 release
  (lenny).

* [fix] Changing debian dependencies.

* [fix] Adding missing install files to build python axl debian
  packages.

* [fix] Fixed PyAxl node.replace, node.set_child and
  node.set_child_after to flag the internal node to be not removed in
  the case the holding document is defined, to avoid deallocating the
  internal node when it was already done by the document
  deallocation. Added regression test to reproduce the bug and check
  the fix (py_test_03).

* [fix] Committing debian files.

* [fix] Adding Makefile.win to allow compiling axl without using
  autotools.

* [fix] Updated package to allow compiling axl without requiring all
  autotools.

* [fix] Updated PyAxlNode internal references to hold a reference to
  the PyAxlDoc associated. Added regression test (py_test_04) to
  reproduce bug and check fix introduced.

* [fix] Updated axl.Node.first_child, get_next, get_previous and
  get_parent to avoid using Py_BuildValue but to directly return
  reference created (fixes memory leak problem).

* [fix] Making axl.Node.set_child to flag to false "finish on gc
  state" based on parent node instead of child node.

* [fix] Making axl.Doc.root to flag the axl.Node reference configured
  to be not deallocated on finish gc.

* [fix] Missing PyAxlNode commit. Fixed log comment at PyAxlNode
  deallocation.

* [fix] Updating module versions.

* [fix] Added missing regtest files.

* [fix] General updates to axl list module to check memory allocation
  operation before continue.

* [fix] Several updates to check alloc operations and to not continue
  on failure. Applied changes to axl doc, axl stack, axl hash, axl
  node and axl error. Still more work required.
