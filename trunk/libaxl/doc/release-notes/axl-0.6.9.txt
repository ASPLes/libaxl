This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  - Minor stable release that includes a memory leak fix and a missing
    check while handling NULL values in some cases at string hashing
    code.

Thanks to
~~~~~~~~~

  - Ralf Konush (reported typo declaration causing Xcode to fail).

  - Maxime Mugard (reported memory leak on hash duplication when
    storing more than 10 items).

Changes from previous release 0.6.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Added SSP by default on linux and/or gcc based platforms.

* [fix] Added missing documentation to axl_casecmp..

* [fix] Removed double parent declaration around 1437 causing Xcode to
  complain. Reported by Ralf Konush.

* [fix] Fixed axlHash deep copy support to have the capability to also
  force key destroy and data destroy functions to be used. API added:
  
  - axl_hash_copy_full

  Used this new support to fix those cases where a node is copied from
  a document where it has more than 10 attributes causing internally
  to use hash to store them. However, the source hash do not have key
  and data destroy function causing a memory leak the copied node is
  released.  Added regression test 49. <<Bug reported by Maxime
  Mugard>>

* [fix] Making axl_hash_string to return 0 when received _key == NULL.

* [fix] Added some additional checks inside axl_hash_string to clarify
  NULL key handling.
