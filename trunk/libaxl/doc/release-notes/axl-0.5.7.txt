This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Fixed several bugs, especially axlList instances using
  axl_list_equal_string. Updated axl node module documentation. Added
  new API functions (compare operations and item list removal by
  position).
  
Thanks to..
~~~~~~~~~~~
  Joan Picanyol (reported building problems that was preventing Axl
  Library to be compiled under some configurations). Lawrence
  MacIntyre (reported wrong enum type declaration).

Changes from previous release 0.5.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Fixing node parsing to avoid loading documents with nodes
  including duplicate attributes.

* [fix] Fixed not proper detection of empty attributes on nodes.
  Added regression test to check the fix. Also added support to check
  for empty values but not bug was found.

* [fix] Updated axl_node_set_attribute internals to also check that
  the attribute name not only is non-null but also contains a value.
  Updated regression test_22 to check fix introduced and memory usage.

* [fix] Removing spurious comma after enum value (Reported Lawrence
  MacIntyre).

* [fix] Replacing file references from ../ to $(top_srcdir)/

* [fix] General changes to make libaxl to be compilable from outside
  sources (for example for building systems that share code). Changes
  introduced fixes problems reported by Joan Picanyol. Also fixes
  documentation building and tests.

* [fix] More fixings to make building system to reference build dir
  rather source directory.

* [fix] Updated axl_doc_dump_to_file and axl_doc_dump_pretty_to_file
  to have file_path flagged with "const".

* [fix] Adding new functions to check doc, node and items to be equal
  but with the ability to report differences on an optional axlError
  reference. API added:

  - axl_node_are_equal_full
  - axl_item_are_equal_full
  - axl_doc_are_equal_full

* [fix] Improved error reporting for axl_doc_are_equal_full and
  axl_node_are_equal_full.

* [fix] Moving to the public API axl_node_content_translate_defaults
  which allows to translate XML escaped content into usual utf-8
  symbols.  API added:

  - axl_node_content_translate_defaults

* [fix] Adding missing documentation to
  axl_node_content_translate_defaults

* [fix] Making axl_node_content_translate_defaults to calculate string
  length in the case content size variable is 0 or -1. Added
  documentation and checked regression test.

* [fix] Fixed axl_list_equal_string implementation. It had a serious
  bug causing string list created with this equal function to not add
  strings that were started by another string already inside the
  list. Added regression test to check its function.

* [new] Added two new functions that allows to remove a particular
  item at a selected position inside a list. Added regression test to
  check them. API added:

  - axl_list_remove_at
  - axl_list_unlink_at
