Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new Axl
Library release.

Axl Library is an small and efficient XML toolkit, written in ANSI C,
and released under the LGPL, that will allow you to produce efficient
and clear code that interfaces with XML data.

The library was produced to support XML requirements needed by
software developed by Advanced Software Production Line, S.L.

At this moment the library is being used by Vortex Library, Af-Arch,
Turbulence, Shaper and Fovap.

Changes from previous release 0.5.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Updates inside axl_stream_printf_buffer to better support
  windows platform and to allow the function to return the real amount
  of memory required on operation where the buffer is not enough big.

* [fix] Fixed Makefile.am files to make dist command to properly
  complete. Removed false references. Fixed typo error. Updated .def
  files.

* [fix] Fixed warnings at libaxl regression test at amd64 platforms.
  
* [fix] Fixed non-portable automake declarations using wild cards not
  supported by all make implementations.

* [new] Updated axl stream API to include a new function to perform
  printf operations on a provided buffer, returning the content used
  and the content that would be required to support the operation in
  the case not enough space is found. Updated regression test to check
  its function (error codes, content returned on error, and sizes
  used).

* [fix] More updates to autogen.sh to include options to warn all
  errors found during autoconf process.

* [fix] Updating autogen.sh to add --Werror to avoiding releasing
  faulty tarballs.

* [fix] Fixed misspell error supposed to be fixed in 0.5.2 (but it
  wasn't).  Re-reported again by Dave Dribin.

* [fix] Fixing regression to properly execute on amd64 platforms.
