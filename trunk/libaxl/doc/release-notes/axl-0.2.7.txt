This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This release comes to fix bugs while handling attributes inside
  nodes and to include a complete new API to perform linear and
  efficient iteration with state over axlList: axlListCursor.

Changes from previous release 0.2.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] fixed a bug inside axl_node_has_attribute and
  axl_node_get_attribute_value which was causing to segfault because
  the basic case were accessing to the hash table where a linked list
  is found.

* [fix] Fixed a bug inside axl_node_set_attribute which was causing to
  not increase the number of attributes added to the node in the case
  a hash table is being used. Added a new regression test to check
  this in the future.

* [new] Added a new complete support to perform iterations over an
  axlList using a cursor that maintains the state. API added:

    - axl_list_cursor_new
    - axlListCursor (type)
    - axl_list_cursor_first
    - axl_list_cursor_last
    - axl_list_cursor_next
    - axl_list_cursor_previous
    - axl_list_cursor_has_next
    - axl_list_cursor_has_previous
    - axl_list_cursor_has_item
    - axl_list_cursor_unlink
    - axl_list_cursor_remove
    - axl_list_cursor_get
    - axl_list_cursor_list
    - axl_list_cursor_free

* [fix] added regression test to check this new API added. 

* [fix] fixed axl_list_prepend and axl_list_append to allow adding null
  values.

* [fix] Committing missing updates to the test_02.c
