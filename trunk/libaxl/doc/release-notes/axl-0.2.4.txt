This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Added more API to manipulate XML document and fixed bugs related to
  DTD validation support.

Changes from previous release 0.2.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] adding additional checks to ensure all nodes are validated,
  avoiding false validations based on partial validations. Added
  regression test.

* [new] Added more functions to the axl node API to allow getting the
  top level document and configuring the top level document (private
  api).  API added:

   - axl_node_set_doc (private)
   - axl_node_get_doc

* [new] adding an internal definition to support boolean type as an
  int.

* [fix] making axl_doc_set_root function to also configure the
  document that is containing the node configured.

* [new] Adding a new function to allow setting CDATA content for a
  selected node.  API added:

    - axl_node_set_cdata_content

* [fix] fixing axl_node_set_content_ref to notify that it is not
  empty, in the case the content received is not null.

* [fix] reoganized module includes to control them at axl_decl.h
  header. Adding refernce to GNUC library support to get access to
  vasprintf function when available.

* [fix] adding new function that allows to create an newly allocated
  string from a printf argument, but also returning the string
  length. API added:

     - axl_stream_strdup_printf_len

* [fix] fixing a validation failure with one-or-many choice sequences
  (..|..|..)+ located at the end of a ELEMENT definiton.

* [fix] making axl_node_get_content_* funcitons to not return NULL
  value when the node has no content but an empty string.

* [fix] fixing some compiler checks done at axl_stream_printf to also
  check a new environment variable __G_OS_WIN32__ (because __GNUC__ is
  activated but not exporting vasprintf).

* [fix] Updated Makefile.win to include this change.
