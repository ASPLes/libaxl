This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Fixed a bug in the axl stream module which was causing to not
  properly read documents with really large content node. Added
  initial implementation for axl-knife, a command line tool built on
  top of Axl. Fixed memory leak in axl list cursor and added some
  convenience macros.

Thanks to..

  Qball Cow (reported large node content problem) and Chris Yourch
  (reported missing libaxl.def into tgz)

  None.

Changes from previous release 0.4.10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

* [fix] Committing empty Makefile.win for axl-knife tool.

* [fix] Fixed temporal buffer used by the axl stream, which is not
  resized once the main buffer is resized.

* [fix] Fixed bug which was causing to not open large content inside
  nodes (limited to 8192 bytes). Updated prebuffering code to allow
  growing as required by the document, reusing the largest
  buffer. Reported by Qball Cow.

* [fix] Fixed documentation problem associated to doxygen.

* [new] Added initial implementation for axl-knife tool. It will
  implement several command line features to manage xml documents.

* [fix] Making Makefile.am file to include libaxl.def file while doing
  make dist. Reported Chris Yourch.

* [fix] Added axl_freev macro, alising axl_stream_freev.

* [fix] Added some macro definitions to easily access to some string
  functions. Updated doxygen documentation. API added:

   - axl_concat
   - axl_split
   - axl_join

* [fix] Fixed bug inside axl_list_cursor_remove which was causing to
  leak the application because the reference was never removed
  (destroy functions called).
