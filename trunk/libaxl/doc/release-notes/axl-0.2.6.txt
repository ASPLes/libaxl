          ###################################

Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new Axl
Library release.

Axl Library is an small and efficient XML toolkit, that will allow you
to produce efficient and clear code that interfaces with XML data.

The library was produced to support XML requirements needed by
software developed by Advanced Software Production Line, S.L. 

At this moment the library is being used by Vortex Library and
Af-Arch.

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Fixed Axl library to compile and properly work on Amd64 running
  Linux. Due to this, checked that Axl Library builds and runs
  properly at: Alpha (running Linux), Openpower (running Linux),
  PowerPC (running Linux), NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Windows and Linux
  (all of them running on x86). 

  More API to the library has been added and more library performance
  improvement has been done. See memory report.

Thanks to
~~~~~~~~~
  Milton Yates for reporting Amd64 problem.

  Thanks to the SourceForge team for its great job and to provide
  access to such compile farm.

Changes from previous release 0.2.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Committing a modification (pending to be authenticated) solving
  a compile problem found at amd64. va_list pointers can't be copied
  using a normal assignation. Updated stream_get_untilv calling to
  pass directly the pointer to args.

* [fix] flag with "const" several functions from inside the axl stream
  module: axl_stream_cmp, axl_stream_strdup, axl_stream_strdup_n,
  axl_stream_strdup_printf, axl_stream_strdup_printfv,
  axl_stream_strdup_printf_len, axl_stream_split and
  axl_stream_concat.

* [fix] Committing a general update to produce a new file
  (axl_config.h) from inside the autoconf process, include includes a
  OS detection macro, and some macro definitions that are platform
  specific. This will solve problems found at the amd64 platform while
  compiling Axl Library.

* [fix] Committing axl_config_win32.h file (specific to the win32
  platform) and Makefile.am updated to include this file into the
  extra dist.

* [fix] updating Makefile.win to use the axl_config_win32.h (because
  axl_config.h) isn't produced if autoconf isn't used.

* [new] Improving axl annotate API to include functions to annotate int,
  string and double values directly without performing castings. API
  added:

    - axl_node_anotate_int
    - axl_node_anotate_string
    - axl_node_anotate_double
    - axl_node_anotate_get_int
    - axl_node_anotate_get_string
    - axl_node_anotate_get_double 

* [fix] Updated test file to include checks for the API elements
  added.

* [fix] Committing more updates to the configure.ac file.

* [fix] updating axl.nsi file (0.2.5 release), Makefile.win to remove
  -DAXL_OS_WIN32 already provided by the configure process.

* [fix] Changing enum names for NodeType declaration to void clashing
  with other common declarations found. Updated source code and tests.

   NODE         -> AXL_ELEMENT_NODE
   ELEMENT_LIST -> AXL_ELEMENT_LIST
   NOT_DEFINED  -> AXL_ELEMENT_NOT_DEFINED

* [new] Added to new support functions to dump xml document
  represented inside memory to a file. API added:

    - axl_doc_dump_to_file
    - axl_doc_dump_pretty_to_file

* [fix] Updated documentation for axl_node_set_comment and
  axl_node_set_child.

* [fix] Reimplemented xml node attribute handling to use an hybrid
  model where attributes are stored in a linked list when they are
  fewer than 10 attributes and automatically use a hash structure if
  it gets bigger than that. This now makes the reference test to move
  its memory usage from 1.890.423 to 1.513.887 and runtime speed from
  0.83 to 0.73. GREAT!!

* [fix] Making axl dumping operations to place attributes in the order
  they were added.

* [fix] fixed __axl_log declaration which was making axl to not
  compile under alpha running Linus platform.

* [fix] making axl library configuration process to detect vasprintf
  function disabling it from the source code if it wasn't found.

* [fix] fixing wrong references at the axl documentation to memory reports.
